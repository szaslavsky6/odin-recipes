            <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder,<br>
                 onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. In a separate small bowl, lightly whisk the two eggs.</li>
            <li>Add the breadcrumb mixture, eggs, milk, Italian sausage, and ground beef <br>
                to a large bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until evenly combined. Avoid over mixing the meat.</li>
            <li>Let the meatball mixture rest for five minutes to allow the breadcrumbs time <br>
                to soften. Divide and shape the meat into about 32 meatballs, approximately 2 Tbsp in volume each.</li>

            <li>Transfer the meatballs to a pot of red sauce and simmer for five more minutes in the sauce. If not using a red sauce, add an additional 3-5 minutes to the bake time, or until the meatballs are cooked through.</li>
