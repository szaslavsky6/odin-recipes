# odin-recipes
For my first project with The Odin Project, I will build a basic recipe website with HTML. 
To complete this project I will be using the HTML skills learned so far in this course.
Those skills include:
    * creating a index.html file with boilerplate.
    * creating headings with the header element.
    * creating paragraphs with the paragraph element.
    * adding links and images to recipe pages.
    * create ordered and unordered lists.
